# rsyncmd

Remote sync and run helper

The idea is to create helper script to copy your current working directory to any SSH-enabled host and be able to launch any commands afterwards.
This can greatly help for development and troubleshooting in variety of situations:

- long-running or CPU-intensive tasks
- multi-OS development
- local security limitations
- backup and access existing development environment from multiple machines or locations

This script is designed to be used independently or with any IDE you like.

## Dotenv

You could use `.env` files to set all your variables. Store this files at your project directories.

## Installation

- Install [Rsync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rsync)
- Setup SSH login to remote server

      $ cp ./rsyncmd /usr/local/bin
